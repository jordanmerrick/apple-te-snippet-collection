{"name":"Apple Products TextExpander Snippet Collection","tagline":"Easily enter or correct the spelling of Apple products","body":"# Apple Products TextExpander Snippet Collection\r\n\r\nA collection of snippets for TextExpander to autocorrect commonly misspelt or incorrect use of letter case in Apple product names.\r\n\r\n## Letter Case Correction\r\n\r\nThese snippets automatically fix the letter case for most Apple products, wherever possible. For example, no matter if you type *iphone 5*, *iPhone 5S* or *Iphone 5s*, TextExpander would correct it to *iPhone 5s* - Apple’s preferred styling.\r\n\r\nSnippets are available for the following product lines:\r\n\r\n- iPod\r\n- iPad\r\n- iPhone\r\n- iPad\r\n- MacBooks\r\n- iMac\r\n- OS X\r\n- Apple TV \r\n\r\n## Product Builders\r\n\r\nThere are some snippets for the following products that you can use to specify exact models:\r\n\r\n- iPhone\r\n- iPad\r\n- iMac\r\n- MacBook\r\n- OS X \r\n\r\nThese snippets include the different letter case options, as well as names if required. \r\n\r\n![OS X builder](apple-snippets-te.png)\r\n\r\n![MacBook builder](apple-snippet-macbook-te.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Download the ZIP file and double-click the `Apple Products.textexpander` file to install. A new group named *Apple Products* will now appear in TextExpander. \r\n2. Change any abbreviations if you find they clash with existing snippets and/or writing. I recommend opening a blank text document and trying a few out to see how they work. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nI’ve made this collection of snippets [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jordanmerrick/apple-te-snippet-collection) for anyone to contribute to, so if you have any additions or modifications you’d like to make, and are proficient with Git, fork the repo and submit a pull request. \r\n\r\nIf you’re not familiar with how Git works, you can make suggestions or report a problem by [creating an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jordanmerrick/apple-te-snippet-collection/issues).

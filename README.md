# Apple Products TextExpander Snippet Collection

A collection of snippets for TextExpander to autocorrect commonly misspelt or incorrect use of letter case in Apple product names.

## Letter Case Correction

These snippets automatically fix the letter case for most Apple products, wherever possible. For example, no matter if you type *iphone 5*, *iPhone 5S* or *Iphone 5s*, TextExpander would correct it to *iPhone 5s* - Apple’s preferred styling.

Snippets are available for the following product lines:

- iPod
- iPad
- iPhone
- iPad
- MacBooks
- iMac
- OS X
- Apple TV 

## Product Builders

There are some snippets for the following products that you can use to specify exact models:

- iPhone
- iPad
- iMac
- MacBook
- OS X 

These snippets include the different letter case options, as well as names if required. 

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP file and double-click the `Apple Products.textexpander` file to install. A new group named *Apple Products* will now appear in TextExpander. 
2. Change any abbreviations if you find they clash with existing snippets and/or writing. I recommend opening a blank text document and trying a few out to see how they work.
